# aoc2023

Advent of Code, 2023!

This year, I decided to be really really dumb.

I'm going to do AoC this year in Rust, having never used Rust myself before.

However... as of Day 2, I'm switching back to Typescript. I'm not going to be able to learn enough Rust to do this, but I will be coming back after AoC is over to try and remake my TS solutions in Rust.
