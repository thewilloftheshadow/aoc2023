# aoc2023

Advent of Code, 2023!

This year, I decided to be really really dumb.

I was going to do AoC this year in Rust, having never used Rust myself before, and I made it through Day 1 doing that.

However... as of Day 2, I'm switching back to Typescript. I'm not going to be able to learn enough Rust to do this, but I will be coming back after AoC is over to try and remake my TS solutions in Rust.

You can find my day 1 solution under the \_old-rust directory.
