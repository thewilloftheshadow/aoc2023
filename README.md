# aoc2023
Advent of Code, 2023!

This year, I decided to be really really dumb.

I'm going to do AoC this year in Rust, having never used Rust myself before.




This should be interesting...


### Structure

Each day will be in a folder with the format `day-##`, where `##` is the day number.
I'll give my thoughts on how it went in a `README.md` file in each folder, as well as what Wakatime says for my time, though I'm not racing the clock at all.




### Notes to self
```
cargo new --lib day-##
cargo run --bin part-1
cargo watch -x "run --bin part-1"
```
