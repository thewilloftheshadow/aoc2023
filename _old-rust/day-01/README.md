# Day 01

## Part 1

Part 1 was fairly straightforward. I learned how regex works, and also used .map() on an Iterator. I enjoyed this one.

### Time

- Initial implementation completed - 23:36
- Bugs fixed - 39:09
- Answer submitted - 40:36

## Part 2

I gave up after 1:32:57. I couldn't figure out how to parse from left to right, so things such as "eightwo" were getting parsed as "eigh2" but it needed to be "8wo".

Maybe I'll come back and look at this later this month when I'm more familiar with Rust
